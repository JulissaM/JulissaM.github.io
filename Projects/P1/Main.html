                AGUAS FRESCAS
            </h1>
            <p>
                Aguas frescas are ubiquitous on the streets of Mexico City and an ideal way to beat the heat during the summer. Literally translated as “fresh waters,” they’re typically made from a blend of fresh fruit, plus water and optional sugar.

                Agua fresca vendors are instantly recognizable due to their distinctive carts, which bear either huge plastic containers holding pre-made juices or fresh fruit ready to be juiced on site. The popularity of the beverage has also given rise to chains such as Michoacana, an agua fresca shop that can be found in almost any Mexican town.

            <p>Aguas frescas are a budget-friendly alternative to excessively sugary bottled drinks, and they are generally available in two sizes, chica or grande. Some vendors, however, sell them only por litro, or by the liter. Ask for no ice if you want to get the most for your money, though even a liter of these addictive concoctions will generally set you back only MXN$20.
