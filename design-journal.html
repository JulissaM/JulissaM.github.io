        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: 
          In this class, I hope to achieve a greater knowledge of making websites and overall enhance my design skills to create user-friendly and creative web designs. One of my greatest interests in design is interactivity no matter how big or discrete. I’m excited to start diving into interactive elements the go into web design that really transform good websites to great websites. Below are some fun sites I really enjoy going through to find inspiration!</p>
        <p>Inspiring site of the week: This website is very beautiful overall but I also really like the navigation and journey through the website.
          <a href="https://www.leiaud.com">Leiaud</a>
          <p>The colors and overall design of this website is super aesthetically pleasing while also having a really great type palette. I also really love the motion and personality certain elements of the website has when you scroll and move your mouse.

            <p>This website is just super fun to play with.

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project 1, the topic I decided to choose is about Aguas Frescas or “fresh water” because I wanted to work with something fun a colorful but also meaningful to myself and my culture. My plan to make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project is to simply focus on the topic of the individual page and build what fits with the information and not just copy the page before. This will be easy since instead of focusing on a different flavor of “fresh water” in each page, the topics I’m focusing on is about Aguas Frescas, the history, recipes, and where to get them locally in Portland. For my imagery, I want to have a nice mix of photography and illustrations and mainly use colors that naturally appear in Aguas Frescas. For typography, I’m planning on using some clean san serif typefaces to not take away too much from the visuals but I also want to incorporate some fun and wavy typefaces that move on your screen to bring some motion onto my project.</p>
